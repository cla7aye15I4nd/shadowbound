# 📜 Artifact Evaluation

> [!NOTE]
> All operations are performed in the root directory of the repository.

## 🛠️ (Step 1) Build

You should use the following command to build the base image, all evaluation is based on the image.

```bash
docker compose up --build shadowbound
```

## 🧪 (Step 2) Basic Test

Our basic test includes using ShadowBound to compile Nginx and run it. You can use the following command to achieve it:

```bash
docker compose up --build nginx-eval
```

After running the command, you can access the result at `eval/nginx/results/shadowbound.txt`. The results should look like this:

```
Running 1m test @ http://localhost:80/index.html
  8 threads and 100 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev

  7149133 requests in 1.00m, 5.68GB read
Requests/sec: 118955.36

```

### 🔗 (Step 3) Integration Test

To show ShadowBound can cooperate with other UAF defenses, we demonstrate how to use ShadowBound+FFMalloc and ShadowBound+MarkUS to compile Nginx and run it.

> [!WARNING]
> You may encounter a `Segmentation fault` during the test. This is due to UAF defense issues, not ShadowBound. If this occurs, try running the test again. In our experience, such issues are relatively rare.

```bash
TARGET=shadowbound-ffmalloc docker compose up --build nginx-eval
TARGET=shadowbound-markus docker compose up --build nginx-eval
```

After running the command, you can access the result at `eval/nginx/results/shadowbound-ffmalloc.txt` and `eval/nginx/results/shadowbound-markus.txt`.

### 🔐 (Step 4) Security Test

In the evaluation, we demonstrate how ShadowBound can prevent real-world vulnerabilities. You can choose to use our pre-built image to run the test or build the image yourself.

#### 🖼️ Use Pre-built Image

```bash
docker pull dataisland/shadowbound-seceval:latest
docker run -it dataisland/shadowbound-seceval /bin/bash
/root/test.sh
```

#### 🔨 Build Image by Yourself

> [!WARNING]
> Please ensure that your network and machine are stable. The building process may take a long time and download a lot of data. 
> If you encounter any problems, please use our pre-built image as a safe choice.

First, build the image with this command:

```bash
docker compose up --build sec-eval
```

Then, enter the container, build all the test cases, and run them:

```bash
docker run -it sec-eval /bin/bash
/root/build.sh && /root/test.sh
```

### ⚡ (Step 5) Performance Test
